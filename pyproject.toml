description = "Facebook Lead Integration is a Frappe application designed to capture and manage leads generated from Facebook ad campaigns directly into your system. It connects with Facebook's API to verify webhooks, receive real-time lead data, and automatically create lead records in Frappe. This app also handles long-lived token management, custom field creation, and dynamic mapping of lead details, offering an efficient and automated solution for managing social media-generated leads within the Frappe framework."
